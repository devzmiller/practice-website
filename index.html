  <p>Welcome to my website about the excellent Marvel superhero Squirrel Girl. She is a girl with the strength and speed of a squirrel. She's also a computer science student. She eats nuts and kicks butts.</p>

  <p>You can read more about Squirrel Girl, AKA Doreen Green, on the <a href="http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Doreen_Green_(Earth-616)">Marvel Wiki</a>. I think this website is a little bit overly busy; its three column layout packs too much content into too little space. But other than the superhero logo background it's what you expect a wiki to look like, so I wouldn't expect them to change things up much.</p>

  <h2>Reasons Squirrel Girl is Awesome</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>She has a big fluffy squirrel tail.</li>
    <li>Squirrels can jump about four feet high. Which means Squirrel Girl can jump about 20 feet high.</li>

    <li>She likes puns.</li>
    <li>She can talk to squirrels.</li>
  </ul>
