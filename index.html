  <p>Welcome to my website about the excellent Marvel superhero Squirrel Girl. She is a girl with the strength and speed of a squirrel. She's also a computer science student. She eats nuts and kicks butts.</p>

  <h2>Reasons Squirrel Girl is Awesome</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>She has a big fluffy squirrel tail.</li>
    <li>Squirrels can jump about four feet high. Which means Squirrel Girl can jump about 20 feet high.</li>
    <li>She's a computer scientist and at one point defeats a villain by teaching him to count in binary on his fingers.</li>
    <li>She likes puns.</li>
  </ul>
